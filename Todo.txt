------------------------------ALL PAGES------------------------------
-Fix that height/whitespace thing (currently hagwartz.css:26 height:80vh)

------------------------------DATABASE------------------------------
-Need to figure out how we want to add users
-Do we want to whitelist available sections on a per course basis? On a per semester, per course basis?
-How the shit are we going to do semesters?



------------------------------INDEX PAGE------------------------------
-Make the background image less squishy if possible? (look into an actual filtering over the homepage)
-On click of login button
    -Load Hagwartz database
    -Load user from database based on name?
    -Fuq da passwords


------------------------------HOMEPAGE------------------------------
-Make the 'graphs' less squishy (maybe split into seperate images?)
-Try to force completed/recommended courses tabs to be always on the same line
-Recommended courses needs to be cleaned up
    -More details than just Dept and Id (short name?)
    -It kinda looks ugly..
    -Add to planner button has zero feedback that an action has ACTUALLY been completed
-Autoload page user content from database?


------------------------------SCHEDULE PAGE------------------------------
-Semesters dropdown needs to reference something
-Export to calander needs to have functionality built in
-On click of secheduled_courses we need to have more info available
    -Maybe open up each matching element in the row?
    -Maybe just include more info for each element?



------------------------------REGISTRATION PLANNER PAGE------------------------------
-scheduled courses need to have more info on click rather than just redirect to the search page
-Try to force words in 'Planner Sections' to left align and not go past any buttons?
-force legend to bottom of page when there is little to none content under 'Planner Sections'
-Clicking register all with multiple conflicts only shows the dialog for the last conflicting course...



------------------------------COURSE CATALOG - PREREQUISITE------------------------------
-Clicking on any of the departments brings up the next graph below the current, and doesn't hide the current
    -Maybe have an ID like thing in the URL that forces the witchwhat graph to show?
-Clicking any graph element should bring up a dialog with more course info rather than redirecting to search page
-Need to add the remaining background images to the other departments
-Autoload graph nodes from Data? (don't quite know how I'd get em to line up in the right spots.. )


------------------------------COURSE CATALOG - SEARCH------------------------------
-Force 'Add to Planner' and 'Add to Compare' buttons to the bottom of the page.
-'Has PreReqs' Filter does nothing (other than all or nothing) 
-'Add To PLanner' reject if course is registered needs feedback (currently just does nothing)  
-'Add Selection to Planner/Compare' should only activate on visible elements where display:"" and ignores display:none



------------------------------COURSE CATALOG - COMPARE------------------------------
-Welp apparently this page is just fucking perfect...
